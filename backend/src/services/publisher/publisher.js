// how this API is used:
//
// An employee downloads all the release or weekly binaries from GitHub into a directory.
//
// They then visit the correct Xavier page and upload each binary via a form. This does an upload to S3 via the
// Lens API downloads endpoint that also contains the details of the nature/sha256/cadence/etc. The API itself does
// a POST (create) is made to the publisher endpoint with the details. For the specific nature/sha256/cadence, all
// previous entries are administratively soft deleted.
//
// When a user visit the download page, the page does a blank find of the all the publisher documents. This only
// returns the active files and shows those along with the lens download URL. This page places a "ouid" cookie into
// the browser session that contains a mildly obscured version of their userId (a hex string) (NOT username, just the
// hex index). Since that ID isn't really private, I'm not too concerned about it.
//
// The download links will look like this:
//   `https://lens.ondsel.com/published/a438f938493849348384/Ondsel_ES-2024.2.2.37240-Windows-x86_64-installer.exe`
//
// When the user downloads that URL, NGINX will catch the "/published" link and do two things:
//
//  - read the cookie from the headers and use LUA to post a "user-engagement" record to the API with the user id.
//  - establish a proxy to the S3 link. Since both S3 and our NGINX server are both on AWS, there is no traffic charge.
//
// From the user's perspective, they are directly downloading from Lens.
//
// If the user does not have a live session cookie, then NGINX will send a 404. So copying the download URL and trying
// it elsewhere will not work.
//
// A seasoned hacker could bypass this by inspecting header data and artificially scripting a mock header session, but
// that is way beyond the skill set of 99.9% of our users.
